title: About Changes to Resource Groups in Greenplum 7
---

VMware Greenplum 7 introduces substantial changes to resource group-based resource management. This topic compares the differences between resource groups with Greenplum 6 and Greenplum 7. Visit [Using Resource Groups](workload_mgmt_resgroups.html) for more information about how resource groups work in Greenplum 7.

The following table compares the main concepts of resource management and how each version of Greenplum Database implements them:

|Metric|Resource Groups in Greenplum 6|Resource Groups in Greenplum 7|
|------|---------------|---------------|
|Concurrency|Managed at the transaction level|Managed at the transaction level|
|CPU|Specify percentage of CPU resources or the number of CPU cores; uses Linux Control Groups|Specify percentage of CPU resources or the number of CPU cores, as well as set upper limits per resource group; uses Linux Control Groups|
|Memory|Managed at the transaction level, with enhanced allocation and tracking; users cannot over-subscribe|Managed at the transaction level, with enhanced allocation and tracking; users can over-subscribe; simpler and more convenient configuration|
|Disk I/O|None|Limit the maximum read/write disk I/O throughput, and maximum read/write I/O operations per second|
|Users|Limits are applied to `SUPERUSER` and non-admin users alike<br>There are two default resource groups: `admin_group` and `default_group`|Limits are applied to `SUPERUSER`, non-admin users, and system processes of non-user classes<br>There are three default resource groups: `admin_group`, `default_group`, and `system_group`|
|Queueing|Queue when no slot is available or not enough available memory|Queue when no slot is available|
|Query Failure|Query may fail after reaching transaction fixed memory limit when no shared resource group memory exists and the transaction requests more memory|Query may fail if the allocated memory for the query surpasses the available system memory and spill limits|
|Limit Bypass|Limits are not enforced on `SET`, `RESET`, and `SHOW` commands|Limits are not enforced on `SET`, `RESET`, and `SHOW` commands. Additionally, certain queries may be configured to bypass the concurrency limit|
|External Components|Manage PL/Container CPU and memory resources|Manage PL/Container CPU resources|

> **Note** Disk I/O limits are only available when you use Linux Control Groups v2. See [Configuring and Using Resource Groups](workload_mgmt_resgroups.html#topic71717999) for more information.

### <a id="attributes"></a>Changes to Resource Groups Attributes

You may configure four new resource group attributes using the `CREATE RESOURCE GROUP` and `ALTER RESOURCE GROUP` SQL commands:
- `CPU_MAX_PERCENT`, which configures the maximum amount of CPU resources the resource group can use.
- `CPU_WEIGHT`, which configures the scheduling priority of the resource group.
- `MIN_COST`, which configures the minimum amount a query's query plan cost for the query to remain in the resource group.
- `IO_LIMIT`, which configures device I/O usage at the resource group level to manage the maximum throughput of read/write operations, and the maximum read/write operations per second. 

In addition, the limit `MEMORY_LIMIT` is now an integer (in MB), instead of a percentage.

The following resource group attributes have been removed:
- `CPU_RATE_LIMIT`
- `MEMORY_AUDITOR`
- `MEMORY_SPILL_RATIO`
- `MEMORY_SHARED_QUOTA`

### <a id="gucs"></a>Changes to Server Configuration Parameters

Greenplum 7 resource group management introduces the following changes to server configuration parameters:

- The possible settings for the [gp_resource_manager](../ref_guide/config_params/guc-list.html#gp_resource_manager) server configuration parameter have changed. They now include the following:
    - `none` - Configures Greenplum Database to not use any resource manager. This is the default.
    - `group` - Configures Greenplum Database to use resource groups and base resource group behavior on the cgroup v1 version of Linux cgroup functionality.
    - `group-v2` - Configures Greenplum Database to use resource groups and base resource group behavior on the cgroup v2 version of Linux cgroup functionality.
    - `queue` - Configures Greenplum Database to use resource queues.

- The new server configuration parameter [gp_resgroup_memory_query_fixed_mem](../ref_guide/config_params/guc-list.html#gp_resgroup_memory_query_fixed_mem) allows you to override at a session level the fixed amount of memory reserved for all queries in a resource group.

- The new server configuration parameter [gp_resource_group_move_timeout](../ref_guide/config_params/guc-list.html#gp_resource_group_move_timeout) cancels the `pg_resgroup_move_query()` function, which moves a running query from one resouce group to another, if it waits longer than the specified number of miliseconds.

- The new server configuration parameter [gp_resource_group_bypass_direct_dispatch](../ref_guide/config_params/guc-list.html#gp_resource_group_bypass_direct_dispatch) bypasses the resource group's limits for a direct dispatch query so it can run immediately. A direct dispatch query is a special type of query that only requires a single segment to participate in the execution.

- The server configuration parameter `gp_resource_group_cpu_ceiling_enforcement` has been removed.

- The server configuration parameter `gp_resource_group_enable_recalculate_query_mem` has been removed.

- The server configuration parameter `gp_resource_group_memory_limit` has been removed.

### <a id="views"></a>Changes to System Views

The following system views have changes:

- The fields `cpu_rate_limit`, `memory_shared_quota`, `memory_spill_ratio`, and `memory_auditor` have been replaced by `cpu_max_percent`, `cpu_weight`, `cpuset`, `min_cost`, and `io_limit` in the `gp_resgroups_config` system view.
- The field `rsgname` has been renamed to `groupname` in the `gp_resgroup_status` system view. 
- The fields `cpu_usage` and `memory_usage` have been removed from the `gp_resgroup_status` system view to the `gp_resgroup_status_per_host` system view.
- The fields `hostname`, `cpu`, `memory_used`, `memory_available`, `memory_quota_used`, `memory_quota_available`, `memory_shared_used`, and `memory_shared_available` have been removed from the system view `gp_resgroup_status_per_host`. The fields `segment_id`, `cpu_usage` and `memory_usage` have been added to the view.
- The fields `rsgname`, `hostname`, `cpu`, `memory_used`, `memory_available`, `memory_quota_used`, `memory_quota_available`, `memory_shared_used`, and `memory_shared_available` have been removed from the system view `gp_resgroup_status_per_segment`. The fields `groupname`, and `vmem_usage` have been added to the view.
- The `gp_resgroup_iostats_per_host` system view has been added.
