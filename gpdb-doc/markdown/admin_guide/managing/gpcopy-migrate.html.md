title: Migrating Data with gpcopy 
---

You can use the `gpcopy` utility to transfer data between databases in different Greenplum Database clusters.

> **Note** `gpcopy` is available only with the commercial release of VMware Greenplum.

`gpcopy` is a high-performance utility that can copy metadata and data from one Greenplum database to another Greenplum database. You can migrate the entire contents of a database, or just selected tables. The clusters can have different VMware Greenplum  versions. For example, you can use `gpcopy` to migrate data from a Greenplum Database version 4.3.26 (or later) system to a 5.9 (or later) or a 6.x Greenplum system, from a Greenplum Database version 5.9+ system to a Greenplum 6.x system, or from a 6.x Greenplum system to a Greenplum 7.x system.

> **Note** The `gpcopy` utility is available as a separate download for the commercial release of VMware Greenplum. See the [VMware Greenplum Data Copy Utility Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Greenplum-Data-Copy-Utility/index.html).
