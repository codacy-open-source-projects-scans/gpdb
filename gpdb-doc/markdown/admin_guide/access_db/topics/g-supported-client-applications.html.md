Users can connect to Greenplum Database using various client applications:

-   A number of [Greenplum Database Client Applications](g-greenplum-database-client-applications.html) are provided with your Greenplum installation. The `psql` client application provides an interactive command-line interface to Greenplum Database.
-   Using standard [Database Application Interfaces](g-database-application-interfaces.html), such as ODBC and JDBC, users can create their own client applications that interface to Greenplum Database.
-   Most client tools that use standard database interfaces, such as ODBC and JDBC, can be configured to connect to Greenplum Database.
