This topic lists limitations and maximums for Greenplum Database full text search objects.

The current limitations of Greenplum Database's text search features are:

-   The `tsvector` and `tsquery` types are not supported in the distribution key for a Greenplum Database table
-   The length of each lexeme must be less than 2K bytes
-   The length of a `tsvector` \(lexemes + positions\) must be less than 1 megabyte
-   The match distance in a `<N>` (FOLLOWED BY) `tsquery` operator cannot be more than 16,384
-   The number of lexemes must be less than 264
-   Position values in `tsvector` must be greater than 0 and no more than 16,383
-   No more than 256 positions per lexeme
-   The number of nodes \(lexemes + operators\) in a tsquery must be less than 32,768

For comparison, the PostgreSQL 8.1 documentation contained 10,441 unique words, a total of 335,420 words, and the most frequent word "postgresql" was mentioned 6,127 times in 655 documents.

Another example â€” the PostgreSQL mailing list archives contained 910,989 unique words with 57,491,343 lexemes in 461,020 messages.
