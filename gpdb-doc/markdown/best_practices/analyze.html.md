title: Updating Statistics with ANALYZE 
---

The most important prerequisite for good query performance is to begin with accurate statistics for the tables. Updating statistics with the `ANALYZE` statement enables the query planner to generate optimal query plans. When a table is analyzed, information about the data is stored in the system catalog tables. If the stored information is out of date, the planner can generate inefficient plans.

## <a id="genstat"></a>Generating Statistics Selectively 

Running [ANALYZE](../ref_guide/sql_commands/ANALYZE.html) with no arguments updates statistics for all tables in the database. This can be a very long-running process and it is not recommended. You should `ANALYZE` tables selectively when data has changed or use the [analyzedb](../utility_guide/ref/analyzedb.html) utility.

Running `ANALYZE` on a large table can take a long time. If it is not feasible to run `ANALYZE` on all columns of a very large table, you can generate statistics for selected columns only using `ANALYZE table(column, ...)`. Be sure to include columns used in joins, `WHERE` clauses, `SORT` clauses, `GROUP BY` clauses, or `HAVING` clauses.

For a partitioned table, you can run `ANALYZE` just on partitions that have changed, for example, if you add a new partition. Note that for partitioned tables, you can run `ANALYZE` on the root partitioned table, or on the leaf partitions (files where data and statistics are actually stored). The intermediate files for sub-partitioned tables store no data or statistics, so running `ANALYZE` on them does not work. You can find the names of the leaf partitions using the `pg_partition_tree()` function:

```
SELECT * FROM pg_partition_tree( 'parent_table' );
```

## <a id="impstat"></a>Improving Statistics Quality 

There is a trade-off between the amount of time it takes to generate statistics and the quality, or accuracy, of the statistics.

To allow large tables to be analyzed in a reasonable amount of time, `ANALYZE` takes a random sample of the table contents, rather than examining every row. To increase the number of sample values for all table columns adjust the `default_statistics_target` configuration parameter. The target value ranges from 1 to 1000; the default target value is 100. The `default_statistics_target` variable applies to all columns by default, and specifies the number of values that are stored in the list of common values. A larger target may improve the quality of the query plannerâ€™s estimates, especially for columns with irregular data patterns. `default_statistics_target` can be set at the coordinator/session level and requires a reload.

## <a id="whenrun"></a>When to Run ANALYZE 

Run `ANALYZE`:

-   after loading data,
-   after `CREATE INDEX` operations,
-   and after `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations that significantly change the underlying data.

`ANALYZE` requires only a read lock on the table, so it may be run in parallel with other database activity, but do not run `ANALYZE` while performing loads, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `CREATE INDEX` operations.

## <a id="conauto"></a>Configuring Automatic Statistics Collection 

The `gp_autostats_mode` configuration parameter, together with the `gp_autostats_on_change_threshold` parameter, determines when an automatic analyze operation is triggered. When automatic statistics collection is triggered, the planner adds an `ANALYZE` step to the query.

By default, `gp_autostats_mode` is `on_no_stats`, which triggers statistics collection for `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`, `INSERT`, or `COPY` operations invoked by the table owner on any table that has no existing statistics.

Setting `gp_autostats_mode` to `on_change` triggers statistics collection only when the number of rows affected exceeds the threshold defined by `gp_autostats_on_change_threshold`, which has a default value of 2147483647. The following operations invoked on a table by its owner can trigger automatic statistics collection with `on_change`: `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, and `COPY`.

Setting the `gp_autostats_allow_nonowner` server configuration parameter to `true` also instructs Greenplum Database to trigger automatic statistics collection on a table when:

-   `gp_autostats_mode=on_change` and the table is modified by a non-owner.
-   `gp_autostats_mode=on_no_stats` and the first user to `INSERT` or `COPY` into the table is a non-owner.

Setting `gp_autostats_mode` to `none` deactivates automatics statistics collection.

For partitioned tables, automatic statistics collection is not triggered if data is inserted from the top-level parent table of a partitioned table. But automatic statistics collection *is* triggered if data is inserted directly in a leaf table \(where the data is stored\) of the partitioned table.
