title: Greenplum Database Best Practices 
---

A best practice is a method or technique that has consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means. Best practices are found through experience and are proven to reliably lead to a desired result. Best practices are a commitment to use any product correctly and optimally, by leveraging all the knowledge and expertise available to ensure success.

This document does not teach you how to use Greenplum Database features. Links are provided to other relevant parts of the Greenplum Database documentation for information on how to use and implement specific Greenplum Database features. This document addresses the most important best practices to follow when designing, implementing, and using Greenplum Database.

It is not the intent of this document to cover the entire product or compendium of features, but rather to provide a summary of *what matters most* in Greenplum Database. This document does not address *edge* use cases. While edge use cases can further leverage and benefit from Greenplum Database features, they require a proficient knowledge and expertise with these features, as well as a deep understanding of your environment, including SQL access, query execution, concurrency, workload, and other factors.

By following these best practices, you will increase the success of your Greenplum Database clusters in the areas of maintenance, support, performance, and scalability.
