-- New strategy of VACUUM AO/CO was introduced by PR #13255 for performance enhancement.
-- Index dead tuples will not always be cleaned up completely after VACUUM, leading to
-- index->reltuples not always equal to table->reltuples, it depends on the GUC
-- gp_appendonly_compaction_threshold. In this case, the ratio of dead tuples is about 30%
-- which is greater than default value (10%) of the compaction threshold, so compaction
-- should be triggered and reltuples of both table and index should be equal.
