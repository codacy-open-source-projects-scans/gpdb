-- committed on all segments except one where COMMIT PREPARED
-- broadcast failed before recovery. Coordinator used to miss sending the
-- COMMIT PREPARED across restart and instead abort the transaction
-- after querying in-doubt prepared transactions from segments.
-- Inject fault to fail the COMMIT PREPARED on one segment.
-- Temporarily disable retry finish prepared in this session, because
-- we are not interested in testing the retry logic.  This makes it
