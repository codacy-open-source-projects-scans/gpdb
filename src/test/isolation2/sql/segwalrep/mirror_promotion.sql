-- Tests mirror promotion triggered by FTS in 2 different scenarios.
--
-- 1st: Shut-down of primary and hence unavailability of primary
-- leading to mirror promotion. In this case the connection between
-- primary and mirror is disconnected prior to promotion and
-- walreceiver doesn't exist.
--
-- 2nd: Primary is alive but using fault injector simulated to not
-- respond to fts. This helps to validate fts time-out logic for
-- probes. Plus also mirror promotion triggered while connection
-- between primary and mirror is still alive and hence walreceiver
-- also exist during promotion.
