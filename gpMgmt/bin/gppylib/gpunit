"""
gpunit is similar to unit2 in python but runs with our GpMgmtTestRunner and GpMgmtTextTestResult.

The TextTestResult from unittest generates multi-line results for unit tests which cannot
be handled by Pulse.

The GpMgmtTextTestResult class has been created to generate one liner results for unit tests 
so that it can be integrated with Pulse.
